Tic Tac Toe game made with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Simple Tic Tac Toe broswer game played between two human players.

Learned:

-   How to use factory functions to generate multiple objects
-   How to use the module pattern to store code that only needs to be generated once
-   How to return functions so elements inside module can be accessed and code can be kept out of global environment
-   Conventional commits structure: working on formatting my commit messages more clearly and making sure each commit is atomic (still needs practice)
